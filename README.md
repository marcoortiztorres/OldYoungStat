Give me a baseball player and I will tell you how good they really are!

The code was meant to run on a jupyter notebook, but it stopped working on my computer.

So instead you can run it from your terminal by running:

```
python main.py
```

you will be prompted to enter in a playerID and if you don't know any by heart, don't worry I have a couple here that you can use

**Good Players:**

- arenano01
- harpebr03

**Bad Players**

- zimmejo02
- gennesc01
